# Where I'm

Trying to fix some doubts about my abilities and figure out where I am.

## Some minor issues

Focus on learning, not create functionalities, something that I usually do,
I think it's slowing down my progress, but I'm no sure about it.

## middle issues

Doubts on my on progress even when I could produce something that is useful
